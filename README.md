# Smith-Waterman-SWAVX
An Updated Smith-Waterman Implementation Using AVX2 Vector Extensions

 - SWAVX_beysian_tuning.py will run the Beysian optimizer to tune the gcc hyperparameters to decrease the size of binary.
 - SWAVX_tuning.py will run a Evolutionary algorithm to tune the gcc hyperparameters to decrease the size of binary or improve the real-time performance.
 - You need a 2-3 datasets of proteins in fasta format to run the code for real-time performance analysis. They should be in the main directory. They are named as test[2-4].fasta
